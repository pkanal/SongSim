I been through where the pope's been
And I've been round where the hope's thin
Rarely pulling out the big win
But the big city sights might be helping with the coping
Hagen halfway on the return flight
A far cry from that hella slow bungalo life
Hitting spain for a week
Kicking game in the heat
With my clothes on my back fresh kicks on the feet
Yo it humbled me, seeing that gaudy gaudi
Slicked hair driving audis
Realized I've got more to be thankful for
Than is always in sight
And in spite of the night
It's really kinda hard to go back to this
When you're hopping the atlas
Eating that tapas
Height worth the hype got your brain doing backflips
Wonder where I’m going if I’m ever gonna catch it

Hold the beat, Keep it steady
Hold the beat, Keep it steady

Too late to find a movie
I’ve felt I have no end
Forced to be loved by no one
You got that Voodoo now

Timid and tepid, I can't rip it and wreck it
I said it read it and it bled it
Vetted credit invented debt and
Now I'm headed level headed unbreaded
Fled where I dreaded netted nothing to tred it
Embedded yet it shedded light
I'm a man on a mission tradition of inefficient
Listen missing the kissing competition dissing and pissing
Sick of wishing for a minute a moment that I could own it
Embolden the hand I'm holding golden keep me from folding
In reach of what I seek I'm just a geek with a beat
And a thought to speak fluid to help tighten the squeak
Creeping crawling and brawling to never follow the fallen
But I'm falling rumble and bumble all the way to the bottom
No pre-meditated method of miracle making fed it
Effort never let it weather I tethered it my soul
Now it's ripping and pulling I'm second guessing
My blessing and stressing so it lessens the lesson
to live in the present
But I'm still here spitting
Still here getting
Everything I ever wanted and some of the stuff I didn't
Even though this game of life can be rugged rigged and rough
I still have a hope to win it that's enough for this chump, yah dig

Hold the beat, Keep it steady
Hold the beat, Keep it steady

Too late to find a movie
I’ve felt I have no end
Forced to be loved by no one
You got that Voodoo now
